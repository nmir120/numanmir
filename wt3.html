										<h2>About the Office of Teaching and Learning</h2>

									<p>For my third co-op work term, and my first remote work experience, I had the opportunity to work for the Office of Teaching and Learning at the University of Guelph. The team that represents this office aims to advance the university’s pedagogy practices through a variety of projects, including research work, informational webinars, training modules for instructors, and more.</p>

												<h3>What did my role consist of?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I was involved in several projects during my work term. Some of them were:
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Post-webinar production:</strong> I was responsible for editing the office’s webinar 
                            series on teaching practices. After editing, I would upload them to YouTube, add closed captioning, 
                            and distribute the link to the webinar’s attendees. I had previous experience editing videos outside 
                            of school, though I became familiar with new editing software, namely, WeVideo and iMovie.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><strong>Website layout re-design:</strong> I assisted in the process of redesigning the Office of 
                            Teaching and Learning’s website. This involved researching other websites with effective layouts, taking 
                            ideas from different sources and piecing them together for inspiration. Through this process, I was able 
                            to exercise my <i>critical and creative thinking skills.</i>
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><strong>Research snapshots:</strong> I read research papers on teaching and learning practices, 
                            gathered information that was important for the reader to know, and used <i>Clear Language Writing</i>
                            to create a summary. I was taught how to use Clear Language Writing by my supervisor, and I believe 
                            this skill will come in handy in any work that involves writing in the future. This project involved 
                            a high level of <i>critical analysis and reflection</i>, which I believe is always important in the field 
                            of computer science, in programming and design.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                        </ul>
												
												  Overall, working on these projects simultaneously helped me strengthen my <i>organization, communication, 
                          and time management skills</i>. I was required to organize my calendar wisely to meet deadlines, communicate 
                          and synchronize with my team members, and learn how to prioritize certain tasks over others.

												<h3>My work term goals</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I had three main goals while working as an Instructional and Technical Support Assistant:
												<ol>
                          <li>
                            <i><strong>Personal Organization and Time Management</strong></i>
                            <br>
                            In my co-op position with the Office of Teaching and Learning, I worked on multiple projects 
                            simultaneously. I felt that in order for me to make meaningful contributions to the projects, 
                            I should work on further improving my organization and time management skills. These skills 
                            are vital in countless areas and will help me in the rest of my studies in computer science, 
                            as I often have to work on multiple assignments and projects at once to meet deadlines.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <i>Reflection:</i> <br>
                            At the beginning of my work term, it was a little overwhelming having several projects to focus 
                            on, each with their own objectives. Shortly after, I started using my calendar and setting deadlines 
                            for myself. I also kept a notes folder on my desktop with separate pages outlining the tasks that I 
                            need to complete for each project. I found these techniques to be very effective, as I was hitting my 
                            deadlines sooner than expected, and was praised by my supervisors for my efforts.
                          </li>
                          <br>

                          <li>
                            <i><strong>Inquiry and Analysis</strong></i>
                            <br>
                            As an Instructional and Technical Support Assistant, I anticipated that some project work would require 
                            a degree of critical thinking and analysis. Specifically, in one of the projects, I had to analyze information 
                            on our team’s website, inquire on how it can be improved, compare it to other websites, and work on solutions 
                            through this process. I wanted to use this opportunity to improve my inquiry and analysis skills.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <i>Reflection:</i> <br>
                            In the website redesign project, I spent a lot of time reflecting and asking what makes a website easy to navigate. 
                            My team members and I shared and combined our ideas and analyzed further. In the future if I decide to pursue web 
                            development, through personal projects or professional work, the inquiry and analysis skills I developed through this 
                            project will come in handy. 
                          </li>
                          <br>

                          <li>
                            <i><strong>Teamwork</strong></i>
                            <br>
                            In one of the projects, I worked closely with my supervisor and co-op teammate to reformat and re-organize an educational 
                            training module. I wanted to focus on exercising my teamwork and collaboration skills, so that my contributions to the 
                            project can flow smoothly with my team members’. I also recognize the importance of being able to co-ordinate with a team 
                            in programming assignments and software development jobs. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <i>Reflection:</i> <br>
                            To make our teamwork as cohesive as possible, I documented all my project work for my team members to see. I frequently 
                            checked in with my team and considered how we can combine our progress. I made note of any questions as they arose and 
                            asked my supervisor for clarification often. Overall, the team’s progress flowed smoothly, and we hit deadlines without 
                            trouble. Through this project, I strengthened my teamwork skills, and got a better understanding of the importance of 
                            communication in coordinating with a team.

                  <p>
                    I would like to thank my supervisors, Dale, Shehroze, Aron, and Brooke, for the wonderful teamwork experiences and leadership that they 
                    provided. They made my transition to remote work as seamless as possible; they always made sure to encourage discussion between team 
                    members and answer questions clearly as possible. I would also like to thank my co-op teammates for being kind and co-operative for the 
                    short time we had together. I’m excited to see what the Office of Teaching and Learning will achieve in the future; I look forward to seeing the university’s pedagogy practices advance thanks to the help of my supervisors and their teams.
