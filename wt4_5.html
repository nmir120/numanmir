									<p>For my fourth and fifth co-op work terms, I was given the
									opportunity to work as a front-end developer for NCR. I worked
									remotely with a team based in Nebraska, Omaha. My team is
									dedicated to the D3 Banking platform, a highly customizable
									online banking application that is tailored for and sold to a
									variety of small and large financial institutions. You can
									learn more about D3 Banking by visiting the website’s

												<h3>What did my role consist of?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As a front-end developer for the D3 team, I had several responsibilities:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Attending daily Scrum meetings:</strong>
                          Our team had a group call every morning in which each
                          of us would report what we worked on during the
                          previous day, what we have planned for the current
                          day, and any obstacles that we may be facing. I really
                          appreciated these meetings as they gave me the
                          opportunity to exercise my communication skills.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><strong>Bug fixes:</strong> I was often assigned
                          tickets which described scenarios in which the banking
                          app is not performing as expected. To tackle these, I
                          would first attempt to replicate the issue to make
                          sure it is still present in the latest version of the
                          application. Then, I would begin the debugging process
                          by finding the source of the bug (usually by tracing
                          the network requests in the Chrome web browser’s
                          DevTools) within the D3 codebase. Once I found the
                          source, I would brainstorm ways to solve the issue and
                          implement a suitable fix.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><strong>Implementing new features:</strong> Other
                          tickets I was assigned highlighted a desired feature
                          to be included in the upcoming version of the D3
                          Banking app, to improve the user interface/experience.
                          Implementing these changes often required discussion
                          with server-side and mobile engineers to ensure proper
                          integration.  
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><strong>Modifying or adding tests to the
                          codebase:</strong> To accompany bug fixes and other
                          code changes, I edited the corresponding test files of
                          the codebase to reflect the newest additions. 
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><strong>Code review:</strong> For each ticket,
                          once I was done making changes to the codebase, I
                          created a pull request on the D3 GitHub page. These
                          pull requests required two members of my team to
                          approve the changes before they can be officially
                          added to the codebase. This was a helpful way to
                          improve my programming skills; senior developers were
                          generous enough to leave feedback on how to make my
                          code more precise or offer an alternative, simpler
                          solution.
                          </li>

												<h3>My work term goals</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I had three main goals while working with the D3 Team of NCR:
                      </p>
												<ol>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Technological Literacy</strong>
                            <br>
                            As a front-end developer, I worked on the user interface
                            of the D3 banking application, which was built with a
                            variety of frameworks and programming languages. In
                            order to maximize my contributions to this app, I aimed
                            to develop and continuously improve my skills with the
                            appropriate programming languages, libraries, and
                            frameworks (JavaScript/TypeScript, React, React Testing
                            Library, and Jest).
                            <br>
                            <em>Reflection:</em> <br>
                            With the help of my mentor, I was able to develop my
                            skills through a variety of online resource he provided,
                            and one-on-one calls in which I was guided on how to
                            work on challenging tickets. As my overall technological
                            literacy skills improved, I was able to write new code
                            and fix bugs with less assistance from others or online
                            resources.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Teamwork</strong>
                            <br>
                            As I knew I would be working with many other members of
                            the D3 team, I aimed to strengthen my teamwork and
                            collaboration skills to ensure maximum productivity.
                            <br>
                            <i>Reflection:</i> <br>
                            To help me achieve this goal, I worked closely with a
                            fellow co-op front-end developer and my mentor on
                            different areas of the D3 Banking app’s user interface.
                            I also made sure that my contributions to the app were
                            well-documented for my team to see, communicated when I
                            needed assistance, and offered my help to my teammates
                            whenever I got the opportunity to. 
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Problem Solving</strong>
                            <br>
                            When writing or fixing code, I knew I would inevitably
                            run into problems that do not have a single
                            straightforward solution. I looked at these as
                            opportunities to work on my creativity in programming.
                            <br>
                            <i>Reflection:</i> <br>
                            When tackling challenging tickets, I found myself
                            searching the web, reading documentation on our software
                            development kits (SDKs) and libraries, and asking my
                            mentor for advice. With this process repeated throughout
                            my work term, I became more confident in my creative
                            programming skills and felt more comfortable taking on
                            abstract tasks related to the banking app.

									<p>
                    I would like to thank my supervisor, Mala, for seeing my
                    potential and encouraging me to take on more challenging
                    tickets as the work term progressed. I am grateful for my
                    mentor, Jason S, for his diligence in making sure I am
                    learning new things and his willingness to guide me through
                    difficulties.  
                    I am also thankful for Jason C, another co-op student who
                    worked as a front-end developer and became my friend over
                    the work term. We helped each other when faced with
                    challenges and learned a lot from each other. A big thank
                    you goes out to the rest of the D3 team; it was a pleasure
                    to work with all of you. With your continued hard work, I am
                    excited to see what the D3 Banking platform will evolve
                    into.
