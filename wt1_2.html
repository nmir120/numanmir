										<h2>About CCS</h2>
									</header>
									<p>For my first co-op work term, I worked for the University of Guelph’s CCS team. The team is oriented around Information Technology and customer service. CCS not only supports all local campus students and staff, but also members of the Ridgetown and Guelph-Humber campus.</p>

												<h3>What does my role consist of?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>At the CCS IT department, the student team members have two alternating positions:
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Help Centre:</strong> At the help centre, students use a ticket system and help clients over the phone or live chat. In our ticket system, we respond to emails from clients. Most of the issues we deal with are IT related, which we help resolve either over phone, email, or live chat. Some of the most common issues students and staff contact us about are usually account and login issues, for example, password resets, or locked accounts. During less busy periods at the help centre, the student team work on side tasks including updating CCS website pages, testing new features, or researching potential technologies that the department is interested in using.</li>
												<br>
												<li><strong>Library Help Desk:</strong> At the library, the student team offers in-person tech support for all campus members. A common issue that we help students with is malware or virus infections. </li>
												<br>
												
												<strong>Skills</strong>
												<br>
												One of the major skills required for this co-op position is <i>customer service</i>. <br>
					
												  	Before this work term, I had little experience with direct customer service. Starting at CCS, I shadowed senior students on the phone and in person until I was ready to help customers on my own. 
													<br>
												  	Additionally, this job requires technological <i>troubleshooting skills</i>, which I had learned previously and further developed during the co-op term through a variety of client issues.
												I believe that both of these major skills are transferrable to lots of positions in the field of computer science and will benefit me greatly in my career.

												<h3>My work term goals</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I had three main goals I aimed for while working with the CCS IT department:
												<ol>
												<li>
												<i><strong>Information Literacy</strong></i>
												<br>
												I aimed to be more resourceful with helpful information and improve my overall information literacy. For example, when helping customers with difficult technical issues, I would like to know where to find the most useful information to help them solve their problems. This skill also translatea well into my field, as programmers and other computer scientists are most efficient when they have good resources, and know how to use them to solve and troubleshoot their problems.
												<br>
												<i>Reflection:</i> <br>
												At the beginning of my work term, I found myself putting clients on hold for long periods as I would gather the resources to help them. I feel that as the work term progressed I became more time-efficient when helping clients with technicial issues due to my improved information literacy and resourcesfulness. I feel more confident in my ability to find solutions to a variety of technological issues, and I believe this skill will prove to be transferrable to other areas in my life, especially my future career.
												</li>

												<li>
												<i><strong>Oral Communication</strong></i>
												<br>
												I focused on improving my interpersonal skills, including my speaking and listening skills. I recognize the importance of these skills in the computer science field, as projects often require teamwork and or communicating with clients to satisfy their needs.
												<br>
												<i>Reflection:</i> <br>
												With little customer service experience prior to this position, I was quite nervous starting out at CCS. Through training, including the online course previously mentioned, listening to senior students converse with clients, I quickly became more confident in my oral communication abilities. I became more and more efficient in asking appropriate questions to troubleshoot client issues. A good sign of progress for me was client feedback; I received several positive ratings through email, in which customers rated my courtesy, knowledge, timeliness, and overall quality of help. I also received 'thank you' emails from customers who were especially satisfied with my ability to communicate effective solutions to their problems.
												</li>
												<li>
												<i><strong>Problem Solving</strong></i>
												<br>
												I concentrated on improving my problem-solving skills when working with customer's difficult problems. I believe having strong problem-solving and troubleshooting skills is essential in my field, especially in programming.
												<br>
												<i>Reflection:</i> <br>
												Throughout the work term, my problem solving and troubleshooting became much more efficient, and as a result I became more comfortable in helping clients with a wider variety of technological issues.  Working on my ability to solve difficult problems here at CCS allowed me to further increase customer satisfaction, and this also allowed me to gain confidence with difficult technical issues.

										<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Jill Hogg, for granting me this amazing oppurtunity to work alongside the CCS team and explore the field of IT support. Jill is an exceptional leader; she always makes sure the student team’s questions are answered, and that the operation of IT support with campus runs as smoothly as possible. I would also like to thank Garrett May from the CCS Managed Desktops team, who often dropped in on the student team and did not leave before he could ensure he got a good giggle out of each one of us. Lastly, I would like to thank the rest of the CCS student team for being so friendly and openly supportive of each other. I look forward to working with everyone again as a part-timer for the rest of my undergraduate studies.</p>
